            <h4> Instructor's Experience</h4>
            <p>
              Collectively, we have been educated in computer science from some of the world's top universities including
              Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, and Harvey Mudd. We also have working experience from Bloomberg, Google, PhaseSpace, etc.
              Some of us are still in college. Others are working in the industry as firmware engineers and software engineers.
              Together, we feel that we can provide a valuable perspective to students who wish to join us this summer!
            </p>

            <h4>Meeting Time</h4>
            <pre>Saturday 10:00-12:00PM. (Location TBD)</pre>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
              Currently, there are not many opportunities to pursue computer science in San Leandro as a secondary school student.
              When I was at San Leandro High School, I took my first CS course in the 2013-2014 school year. It was terrible!
              Instead of learning, students played Tetris and various card games in class. What I found in college, however,
              is that computer science is a very interesting and fun topic. So, this course is an attempt to provide an opportunity
              for young students to pursue CS by exposing them earlier with the insights that come from the instructors' experience.
              Additionally, some of the instructors feel that if students happen to like technology, careers in tech
              provide one path to socioeconomic mobility that can help improve the future outcomes of young people.

            <h4>Course Description</h4>
            <p>
              This is a summer course designed to give high school students an opportunity to learn about computer
              science so that students can learn on their own. To do so, the course will primarily focus on using
              Python as the programming language of choice and follow three modules involving graphics programming
              with Processing, data processing with the scientific libraries (matplotlib, pandas, numpy), and end
              with modeling the real world. In the end, students will have a taste of what programming is like, so
              that they can make their own informed choices about pursuing computer science in the future.
            </p>

            <h4>Worksheets</h4>
            <p>
              Worksheets will be provided online each week before class, so students have a reference on what topics
              will be covered and exercises to practice skills.
            </p>

            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>
              Preferably, students will bring their own laptops, so that they can feel more ownership with the code that
              they write. However, since our focus is in on San Leandro, most students do not have access to laptops, so
              we will do our best to provide the necessary equipment each week.
